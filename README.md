Tour du Monde is a work in progress for a 2D road bike game.

The idea is that we simulate a complete road bike with its gearing and the physics behind it (incline/decline effect on acceleration/deceleration).

We have stages in JSON format with waypoints and POIs and can ride these with alternating key presses to simulate pedalling.
That way the community can create every stage that was ridden in the world very easily.

I'm stuck with the canvas road simulation. Maybe you have an idea. Forks or pull requests are welcome.

You can test-play the game here: https://tour-du-monde.schleifenbaum.ch/
