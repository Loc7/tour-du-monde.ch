Tour du Monde is a work in progress for a 2D road bike game. The idea is that we have stages in JSON format with waypoints and POIs and can ride these with alternating key presses to simulate pedalling. Help is much appreciated. Maybe a rewrite is necessary. Just download the game and see what I mean.
